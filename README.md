Cloud Assets Module
===================
Rackspace CloudFiles Driver
---------------------------

CloudAssets module allows you to host all or part of the assets folder on a cloud storage container (CDN).
You can find more details about how it works here: <https://github.com/markguinn/silverstripe-cloudassets>

This driver gives you the bucket type RackspaceBucket for connecting to CloudFiles.

This module can happily co-exist with other bucket driver modules (which don't exist at the time of this writing).


Requirements
------------
- Silverstripe 3.1+
- Cloud Assets module
- Rackspace php-opencloud

Best way to install by far is `composer require markguinn/silverstripe-cloudassets-rackspace`.


Example
-------
Assuming you have a CloudFiles container called site-uploads:

*mysite/_config/cloudassets.yml:*
```
---
name: assetsconfig
---
CloudAssets:
  map:
    'assets/Uploads':
      Type: RackspaceBucket
      BaseURL: 'http://yourcdnbaseurl.com/'
      Container: site-uploads
      Region: ORD
      Username: yourlogin
      ApiKey: yourkey
      LocalCopy: false
      ServiceNet: false         # use the rackspace servicenet
      ForceDownload: false       # add Content-disposition headers to uplaoded files
```

Contributions welcome by pull request and/or bug report.
Please follow Silverstripe code standards (tests would be nice).

I would love for someone to implement some other drivers - S3, Swift, Google, etc.
It's very easy to implement drivers - just extend CloudBucket and implement a few
methods.
